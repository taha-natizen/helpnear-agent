## Problem
When arriving in a new place, people often struggle to find reliable help.  
Existing platforms are overloaded with irrelevant info, language barriers, and fake or unverified listings.

---

## Solution
HelpNear Agent shows only relevant and verified providers.  
With filters (open now / language / budget), users save time, reduce stress, and access real help faster.

---

## Key Features
- Nearby search with verification ("trust-stamp")  
- Multilingual support  
- Budget filter (affordable / premium)  
- History of requests  
- User submissions (add new providers)  
- One-click navigation or call  
- **Language Bridge** — interface adapts to the user’s language, while communication with providers is automatically translated into the local language. Messages can be sent in both versions, and templates cover common situations (e.g., asking if someone at a clinic speaks English).
